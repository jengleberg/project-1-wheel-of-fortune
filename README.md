# Project Explanation

This Wheel of Fortune Game was designed using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.  

I started out by building the HTML template with the various divs, buttons, etc.. based on my wireframe.  

I then did basic styling in order to have a visual of the game board. 

The next step was created the js code.  I first focused on the spinning wheel, which turned out to be much more difficult than I had anticipated.  After moving the wheel to the stretch portion of my user stories, I then focused on the puzzles and game board.  The first attempt I made was to use a table in order to store the puzzles and have them act like "turning tiles".  This approach is most likely the optimal approach, but I ended up creating a div and used this to create the game board. 

Unsolved problems

1. Spinning Wheel Logic: Get wheel to spin on click. (This was working, but I broke it attempting to get the prize logic in place.)
2. Return the matching prize based on the spinning wheel end position.
3. Store the prize amount and add it to the players score, times the number of correct letters.
4. Create buy vowel logic.
5. Create Bankrupt and Lose Turn Logic. (dependent on returning value from spin.)
6. Store Game winnings for correctly solving the puzzle and add it to the total bank for the player.
7. Store Player Names 

Future enchancements

1. Rebuild game board to make it look more realistic.
2. Add better styling.


Major Lesson Learned:  Planning!!!  I need to improve on spending time at the beginning of the project in order to properly pseudocode and map out all of the functions that need to be built.  Also included is taking time to think out how best to approach each item. i.e. contructor functions, prototype functions, what variables do I need and should they be global..


Conclusion:  While his project was much more difficult than I anticipated it would be, I did learn a lot and am excited to finish this game to it's completion.  I need to practice CSS styling, especially positioning,  and need to continue to practice javascript.
